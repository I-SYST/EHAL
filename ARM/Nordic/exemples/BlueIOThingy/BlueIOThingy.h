@brief	Environmental Sensor BLE demo (Supports BME280, BME680, MS8607).

This application demo shows Thingy compatible environmental sensor using EHAL library.
It sends Temperature, Pressure, Humidity (TPH) data in Thingy compatible format.
Support I2C and SPI interface


NOTE : The BME680 Air Quality Index is undocumented.  It requires the library
Bosch Sensortec Environmental Cluster (BSEC) Software. Download from
https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/bst/products/all_products/bsec and put in
external folder as indicated on the folder tree.

The BSEC library must be initialized in the main application prior to initializing
this driver by calling the function

bsec_library_return_t res = bsec_init();
